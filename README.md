## 🧠 About the Portfolio

This portfolio is not just a collection of sections — it reflects how I think about building software.

- Component-driven architecture
- Reusable design system
- Dark mode by default
- Smooth but purposeful animations
- Clean UX with minimal visual noise

The goal was to build something **professional, scalable, and honest** — not flashy for the sake of it.
